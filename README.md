<h2> Summary</h2>
This is a brief walk through on how to connect a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using Proton VPN. This will be based on the main computer using a macOS. <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machine)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop
- Proton VPN

<h2>Operating System(s) Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b> 

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- A Subscription with Microsoft Azure (FREE $200 USD worth of credit!)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop (FREE!)
- An Account with Proton VPN (FREE!)
- *Highly recommended to subscribe and install to Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Remote Desktop prior to the implementation stage. Subscribe to Proton VPN, but the installation will take place during implementation. Be sure to safely record your user names and passwords.*

<p>
In Microsoft Azure, create a Virtual Machine. Name the Resource Group and Virtual Machine. You can set the region to a location other than where you live. For this instance, the region has been set for North Europe. Select Windows 10 Pro for Operating System. Select an appropriate size Virtual Machine, such as Standard with 2 vcpus and 16 GiB memory. Create a User Name and Password. (You might want to copy this information down for later use.) (Be sure to check the license agreement box in the bottom left hand corner.) Click create. The above image is a VM generated by Microsoft Azure.

</p>
<p>
Copy or Write down the VM's Private IP address. In this case, 20.123.35.28. Access Microsoft Remote Desktop, add a PC, and add the VM's IP address to it. Connect using your user name and password.

</p>
<p>
In the Windows 10, there is a Microsoft Edge to connect to the Internet. Open up a browser. Add type in the web address: <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com"> whatismyipaddress.com </a>
</p>
<br />

<p>
Since the region in the VM was set to North Europe, the IP address of 20.123.35.28 is set to be in Dublin, Ireland.
