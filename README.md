<h2> Summary</h2>
The following is a brief walk through on how to connect a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine (VM) to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) using Proton VPN. There is no special computer coding involved like you see in the movies. This is a brilliant and secure way for those who work remotely, who travel abroad, and who utilize the computer in spaces with public WIFI. In this walk through, a Microsoft Azure VM will connect to a VPN using Proton VPN's Wireguard.   <br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/"> Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machine)</a>
- <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id1295203466?mt=12"> Microsoft Remote Desktop </a>
- <a href="https://protonvpn.com"> Proton VPN </a>

<h2>Operating System</h2>

- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b> 

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- A Subscription with Microsoft Azure (FREE $200 USD worth of credit!)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop (FREE!)
- An Account with Proton VPN (FREE!)
- *Highly recommend to subscribe and to install Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Remote Desktop prior to the Implementation stage. Also, create an account with Proton VPN, but the installation will take place during implementation in the Remote Desktop. Be sure to safely record your user names and passwords.* 
  
<h2>Implementation</h2>

</p>
<p>
In Microsoft Azure, create a VM. Name the Resource Group and VM. You can set the region to a location other than where you live. For this instance, the region has been set for North Europe. Select Windows 10 Pro for the Operating System. Select an appropriate size VM, such as Standard with 2 vcpus and 16 GiB memory. Create a User Name and Password. (You might want to copy this information down for later use.) (Be sure to check the license agreement box in the bottom left hand corner.) Click create. The above image is a VM generated by Microsoft Azure.

</p>
<p>
Copy or write down the VM's Private IP address. In this case, 20.123.35.28. Access Microsoft Remote Desktop, add a PC, and add the VM's IP address to it. Connect using your user name and password.
</p>

</p>
<p>
In the Windows 10, there is a web broswer called Microsoft Edge. Open it up, and type in the web address: <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com"> whatismyipaddress.com </a>
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Since the region in the VM was set to North Europe, the IP address of 20.123.35.28 is portrayed to be in Dublin, Ireland.

</p>
<p>
In Microsoft Edge, go to the Proton VPN website: <a href="https://protonvpn.com"> protonvpn.com </a>. Download the Proton VPN for Windows on the Remote Desktop.
</p>
<br />

<p>
The VM's IP Address of 20.123.35.28 is displayed. The purple triangles indicate the available VPNs in that region. In the left box, scroll down and select Japan. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Japan (JP-FREE#719002) with an IP Address of 37.19.205.194. We can now refresh or re-enter <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com"> whatismyipaddress.com </a>.  
</p>
<br />

<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
Even though the VM connected to a VPN in Japan, the region displayed is Casablanca, Morocco. Select Disconnect on the Proton VPN. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
The VM's original IP address of 20.123.35.28 reappears. You can also revisit <a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com"> whatismyipaddress.com </a>. The VM's original IP address and region will be displayed on the website.

</p>
<p>
Be sure to Sign Out of Proton VPN. Delete the PC in Microsoft Remote Desktop. Delete all Resource Groups associated with this VM. (The $200 USD worth of credit expires in 30 days. Plus leaving unncessary Resource Groups and VMs will eat at the credit.) Sign out of Microsoft Azure.
